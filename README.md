# OpenPCDet fork

`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[PointRCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04244), [`[Part-A^2 net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670) and [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192). 

This fork provides the exact version used on Master's Final Project written by **Javier del Egido**. The project studies state-of-the-art Detection and Multi-Object Tracking  (DAMOT) proposals in order to desing a funcional pipeline to be embebbed on Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier mounted on ["Techs4AgeCar vehicle"](http://www.robesafe.uah.es/index.php/es-es/) developed by ["Robesafe research group"](https://github.com/RobeSafe-UAH).
The fork provides ROS communications from PointCloud2 input to custom ["AB3DMOT Tracking module"](https://github.com/JavierEgido/AB3DMOT) in order to set a functional real-time Detection and Multi-Object Tracking (DAMOT) pipeline.

ROS messages provided by ["BEV_tracking ROS"](https://github.com/JavierEgido/bevtracking) package are needed.

## Introduction


### What does `OpenPCDet` toolbox do?

Note that we have upgrated `PCDet` from `v0.1` to `v0.2` with pretty new structures to support various datasets and models.

`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.

Based on `OpenPCDet` toolbox, we win the Waymo Open Dataset challenge in [3D Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-detection/), 
[3D Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-tracking/), [Domain Adaptation](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/domain-adaptation/) 
three tracks among all LiDAR-only methods, and the Waymo related models will be released to `OpenPCDet` soon.    

We are actively updating this repo currently, and more datasets and models will be supported soon. 
Contributions are also welcomed.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the installation of `OpenPCDet`.


## Quick Demo
Please refer to [DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for a quick demo to test with a pretrained model and 
visualize the predicted results on your custom data or the original KITTI data.

## Getting Started

Please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to learn more usage about this project.

To directly inference on ROS point cloud, run:
  ```
  $ python inference.py
  ```
You may need to adjust input point cloud name at the end of code. Also some parameters can be tuned:
- [x] Movelidartocenter (in meters): moves point cloud along X-axis in order to inference over 360º. By default, detection grid only applies over front point cloud.
- [x] Threshold (0 to 1 float): sets score minimum threshold for objects to be published as detected.

## Docker

If you prefer to install OpenPCDet as a Docker image, you can download provided image on ["link"](https://mega.nz/file/2UJyBRDB#gb0Iz5FWhR2kuLAbHNAzhsrv4Zu74NW5Eg9pEasLfME).
Install docker image by using: docker load --input OpenPCDet.tar 

## License

`OpenPCDet` is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgement
`OpenPCDet` is an open source project for LiDAR-based 3D scene perception that supports multiple
LiDAR-based perception models as shown above. Some parts of `PCDet` are learned from the official released codes of the above supported methods. 
We would like to thank for their proposed methods and the official implementation.   

We hope that this repo could serve as a strong and flexible codebase to benefit the research community by speeding up the process of reimplementing previous works and/or developing new methods.

## `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dataset_vs_model.png" width="95%" height="320">
</p>

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:

* Support various models within one framework as:
